YouTube Video Downloader and Audio Extractor
This Python script enables users to download YouTube videos, extract their audio, and save it as an MP3 file. It leverages two powerful libraries: yt_dlp for downloading videos and moviepy for video processing capabilities.

Features:

YouTube Video Download: Users can input any valid YouTube video URL to download the video in the best available quality.
Video Preview (if Pygame installed): It attempts to preview the downloaded video using Pygame, providing a glimpse of the video content.
Audio Extraction: The script automatically extracts the audio from the downloaded video and saves it as an MP3 file (my_audio.mp3).
Automatic Cleanup: After processing, the downloaded video file (downloaded_video.mp4) is deleted to free up disk space.


Libraries Used:

yt_dlp: A versatile library for downloading videos from YouTube and other video platforms, offering more features than the standard youtube_dl.
moviepy: A comprehensive library for video editing, manipulation, and processing in Python. It provides functionalities like extracting audio from videos.


Requirements:

Python Libraries: Ensure you have yt_dlp and moviepy installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install yt-dlp moviepy
Pygame (optional): Required for video preview functionality (clip.preview()). Install it separately if you wish to enable this feature:
pip install pygame


Usage:

Input: Run the script and enter a valid YouTube video URL when prompted.
Processing: The script will download the video, extract its audio, and optionally preview the video using Pygame if installed.
Output: It will generate an MP3 file (my_audio.mp3) containing the extracted audio from the video.


Note:

Ensure your environment meets the prerequisites (Python with required libraries installed).
Video preview feature (clip.preview()) requires Pygame to be installed separately.
